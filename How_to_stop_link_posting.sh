# How to stop server members from posting links
Use the "linkspam" feature on Carl-bot to automatically delete any link posting by any user who **does not** have any role assigned:
#1- Add Carl-bot to your server: https://carl.gg/
#2- Run the command `!linkspam` to check linkspam's current settings.
#3- Run `!linkspam punishment delete` to set "delete post" as the punishment.
#4- Run `!linkspam norole` to "punish" only users **without **roles.
#5- Run `!linkspam 1 1` to set the limit rate of linkspam to 1 post per second i.e., effectively block all link posting.
#6- Run again `!linkspam` to check the new settings.
# Reference: https://docs.carl.gg/#/automod?id=spam-settings # Then click on the "Links" tab.
